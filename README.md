🚀 Passionate Computer Scientist | Software Developer | Research Enthusiast 🧬 

Hello! I'm Revanth Siva Sai Ram Balineni, and I'm on a mission to leverage technology and innovation to make a positive impact in the world of computer science. With a strong educational foundation and practical experience, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table.

📚 **Education:**
- Master's in Computer Science, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY (Present)
- B.Tech in Computer Science, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida, India (GPA: 8.43/10) - Specialized in Data Science and minored in Mathematics.

💼 **Work Experience:**
- As a Software Developer at DBS Bank (Development Bank of Singapore), I led the enhancement of the pre-approval process within the Alternative Lending platform. I focused on Backend Development, crafting microservices and RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. My contributions resulted in a 35% reduction in turnaround time by streamlining the codebase. I also have experience with tools like Bitbucket (Git) for version control and Jenkins for deployment.

- During my time as a Research Intern at IIT Tirupati, I delved into cutting-edge topics like Ligand to Site Mapping and Ligand to Vector mapping. I applied machine learning techniques, PyTorch, and CUDA modules to map ligand vectors to binding sites, and developed innovative vectorization techniques. My work involved data extraction from the National PLIC database by IISc.

- I also had the privilege of serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at Shiv Nadar University, where I supported the Object-Oriented Programming course. I developed lab assessments, implemented anti-plagiarism measures, and provided guidance to fellow students.

💡 **Skills:**
- Languages: Java, Python, C/C++, SQL, PHP, Angular, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: Spring Boot, GIT, Postman, Swagger, RedHat OCP, Jenkins

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and data science to solve real-world problems. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.

Let's connect! I'm open to discussing opportunities, collaborations, and exchanging insights with like-minded professionals in the field of computer science and software development. Together, we can make a difference. 👨‍💻🌟
